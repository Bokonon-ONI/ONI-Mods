[h1]Piped Sweepy Dock[/h1]

[h1]Purpose[/h1]
I had read about how useless the Sweepy and it's dock is so I never built one.  I was bored and wanted to see it in action for myself.  
I had a use in mind so I setup what I thought was a good use for Sweepy only to be sadly disappointed.  If the Dock can't be emptied by an autosweeper or have an output for a conveyor rail, 
I just don't see using it.  I looked in the Workshop and found [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2042663291&searchtext=sweepy]Zonkeeh's Configurable Sweepy Stats mod[/url].  It does a lot more than I wanted but said it could add what I wanted.  
I enabled the mod, edited the config and built a Sweepy.  Sure enough there was an output port.  So I hooked it up, watched and waited.  
And waited and waited, and the dock never sent it's storage off on the rails.  Steam page for Zoonkeeh's mod has a few others saying the same thing so I tried to fix his mod.  
I couldn't get that working so rather than wait for him to get back to me, this mod was born.  His changed the vanilla building, mine adds a new one.

Adds a new building, the Piped Sweepy Dock which adds conveyor rail output.

I did test this with Zonkeeh's mod and it seemed to work fine with the new building type also.  I did not test it heavily though so I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't work well together, 
I did not put any effort into compatibility, I just got lucky.
