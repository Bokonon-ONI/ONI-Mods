[h1]Disable Instant Build On Savegame Load[/h1]

[h1]Purpose[/h1]
This is to solve the problem I have when testing stuff and I bounce a bit between a debug/sandbox map and a survival map.  If Instant Build Mode is active for my debug map, when I would load my survival map it would still be active.  This changes the behavior so that on loading any save, Instant Build Mode is automatically deactivated.
