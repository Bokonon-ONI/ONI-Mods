[h1]Insulated Farm Tiles[/h1]

[h1]Purpose[/h1]
Insulated versions of the Farm and Hydroponic Tiles. They both take 200kg of the same materials as needed for regular Insulated Tiles. They unlock with the same research (Gourmet Meal Preparation) as the Gas Range and can be found in the Food menu.

Future plan is to try and make them need two researches to unlock each type. You'd need both Insulated Tiles as well as Farm or Hydroponic Tiles unlocked to have these unlocked. This should be doable, there are other buildings that have dual requirements, it might even be easy but then again it might not :P

I'm sure there are other uses for these but the main inspiration for this mod was all the people complaining about wheezeworts needing phosphorite so they couldn't seal their builds in insulation. Well now your farm tiles can be the insulation and still be fed from outside a sealed room.
