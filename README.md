# **Bokonon's Oxygen Not Included mods**

These are my mods, hope others can find them of some use.

## **Released Mods**

**Disable Instant Build On Savegame Load**
- This was to solve the problem of bouncing between a debug/sandbox map leaving Instant Build Mode active whe I would load my survival map.

## **Works In Progress**

**Insulated Farm Tiles**
- Insulated versions of farm and hydroponic tiles.  Many people are frustrated that wheezeworts now require resources to be deliverd, this should enable you to do so from outside but still be insulated from temperature.

## **Bugs and Feature requests**
- Please use the github [issues](https://github.com/Bokonon-ONI/ONI-Mods/issues) page for reporting bugs or requesting new features
